Executive Summary
Global growth is projected to decelerate sharply this year, to its third weakest pace in nearly three decades,
overshadowed only by the 2009 and 2020 global recessions. This reflects synchronous policy tightening aimed
at containing very high inflation, worsening financial conditions, and continued disruptions from the Russian
Federation’s invasion of Ukraine. Investment growth in emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs)
is expected to remain below its average rate of the past two decades. Further adverse shocks could push the
global economy into yet another recession. Small states are especially vulnerable to such shocks because of their
reliance on external trade and financing, limited economic diversification, elevated debt, and susceptibility to
natural disasters. Urgent global action is needed to mitigate the risks of global recession and debt distress in
EMDEs. Given limited policy space, it is critical that national policy makers ensure that any fiscal support is
focused on vulnerable groups, that inflation expectations remain well anchored, and that financial systems
continue to be resilient. Policies are also needed to support a major increase in EMDE investment, including
new financing from the international community and from the repurposing of existing spending, such as
inefficient agricultural and fuel subsidies.

GLOBAL ECONOMIC PROSPECTS | JANUARY 2023                                                                            CHAPTER 1   3



Global growth is expected to decelerate sharply to 1.7 percent in 2023—the third weakest pace of growth in
nearly three decades, overshadowed only by the global recessions caused by the pandemic and the global financial
crisis. This is 1.3 percentage points below previous forecasts, reflecting synchronous policy tightening aimed at
containing very high inflation, worsening financial conditions, and continued disruptions from the Russian
Federation’s invasion of Ukraine. The United States, the euro area, and China are all undergoing a period of
pronounced weakness, and the resulting spillovers are exacerbating other headwinds faced by emerging market
and developing economies (EMDEs). The combination of slow growth, tightening financial conditions, and
heavy indebtedness is likely to weaken investment and trigger corporate defaults. Further negative shocks—such
as higher inflation, even tighter policy, financial stress, deeper weakness in major economies, or rising
geopolitical tensions—could push the global economy into recession. In the near term, urgent global efforts are
needed to mitigate the risks of global recession and debt distress in EMDEs. Given limited policy space, it is
critical that national policy makers ensure that any fiscal support is focused on vulnerable groups, that inflation
expectations remain well anchored, and that financial systems continue to be resilient. Policies are also needed
to support a major increase in EMDE investment, which can help reverse the slowdown in long-term growth
exacerbated by the overlapping shocks of the pandemic, the invasion of Ukraine, and the rapid tightening of
global monetary policy. This will require new financing from the international community and from the
repurposing of existing spending, such as inefficient agricultural and fuel subsidies.

     BOX 1.1 Regional perspectives: Outlook and risks
     The forecast for growth in 2023 and 2024 combined has been downgraded for every emerging market and developing
     economy (EMDE) region. Monetary policy tightening, and restrictive global financial conditions are slowing growth,
     especially in LAC, SAR, and SSA. Persistently elevated energy prices are expected to dampen outlooks for energy importers
     in all regions, while falling metals prices will weigh on terms of trade in LAC and SSA. The projected slowdown in
     advanced economy import demand is expected to especially impact EAP and ECA. Added to the pandemic-induced
     recession and incomplete recovery, the outlook implies feeble per capita income growth in LAC, MNA, and SSA in the half
     decade to 2024. Risks to the baseline forecasts are skewed to the downside in all regions. They include the possibility of
     financial stress and greater spillovers from major advanced economy weakness (especially in EAP, ECA, LAC, and SSA),
     commodity price shocks (especially in ECA, EAP, and SAR), conflict (particularly in ECA, MNA, and SSA), and natural
     disasters (with elevated risk in subregions in EAP, LAC, and SAR).

   BOX 1.1 Regional perspectives: Outlook and risks (continued)

     FIGURE B1.1.1 Regional outlooks
     Growth forecasts have been downgraded in all EMDE regions since June, reflecting external headwinds as well as
     weakening domestic conditions. In almost all regions, per capita income growth in 2020-24 is expected to be far below 2010-
     19 averages. Monetary policies have been tightened in many EMDEs to combat inflation and stave off external financing
     pressures. Amid high inflation, real effective exchange rates have appreciated in most EMDE regions.

     BOX 1.2 Recent developments and outlook for low-income countries
     Growth in low-income countries (LICs) is forecast to be 5.1 percent in 2023. Despite this year’s aggregate pickup,
     projections have been revised down for about two-thirds of LICs. Moreover, per capita income growth is expected to be a
     more subdued 2.2 percent in 2023. LICs are facing severe cost-of-living pressures, worsened by disruptions to global
     commodity markets—particularly for energy and staple cereals—following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Many more people
     have fallen into extreme poverty and food insecurity due to soaring food and fuel prices. The outlook for many LICs has
     deteriorated amid surging inflation, tightening financial conditions, fiscal and debt pressures, slowing activity in key
     trading partners, and heightened fragility. Risks to the baseline projections are mainly to the downside, including high
     inflation, resurgence of violence, debt distress in several countries, new COVID-19 outbreaks, and adverse weather events
     owing to climate change.

     FIGURE B1.2.1 LICs: Recent developments
     The sharp slowdown in global growth and the surge in global inflation have dampened economic recoveries across low-
     income countries (LICs). Terms of trade across LICs worsened further last year amid a sharp weakening of demand for
     industrial metals in key trading partners. The cost-of-living crisis has pushed many more people into poverty and food
     insecurity, especially in LICs where fragility was already elevated before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

     A. Similar to Gruss and Kebhaj (2019), commodity terms-of-trade are calculated as changes in real commodity prices weighted by each commodity’s net export share in
     GDP. Figure calculated using median net export shares for the sample of 15 non-oil exporting LICs. A negative change indicates deterioration in the terms of trade. Last
     observation is November 2022.

     Activity in low-income countries (LICs) is expected to firm somewhat in the forecast horizon, albeit with substantial
     heterogeneity among individual countries. Weaker per capita income growth, together with elevated levels of violence, would

     LICs. Average GDP growth rates calculated using constant GDP weights at average 2010-19 prices and market exchange rates. Sample comprises 22 LICs, which
     include 13 fragile LICs.
     B. Extreme poverty rate is measured as the share of people living on less than $2.15 per day. Per capita income is calculated as each group’s GDP divided by each
     group’s population. Dashed lines indicate per capita income assuming its growth rate equals to 2000-19 average after 2019. Sample excludes Democratic Republic
     of Congo and Niger—both with over half of population experiencing extreme poverty.

       a. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Somalia are not forecast on account of data limitations.
       b. Aggregate growth rates are calculated using GDP weights at average 2010-19 prices and market exchange rates.
       c. Forecasts for Afghanistan (beyond 2021), the Syrian Arab Republic (beyond 2023), and the Republic of Yemen (beyond 2023) are excluded because of a high
       degree of uncertainty.
       d. GDP growth rates are on a fiscal year basis. For example, the column labeled 2022 refers to FY2021/22.
       g. Extreme poverty rate is measured as the share of people living on less than $2.15 per day. Per capita income is calculated as each group’s GDP divided by each
       group’s population. Sample excludes Democratic Republic of Congo and Niger—both with over half of population experiencing extreme poverty.

1. Emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) include all those that are not classified as advanced economies and for which a forecast is published for this report. Dependent
territories are excluded. Advanced economies include Australia; Austria; Belgium; Canada; Cyprus; Czechia; Denmark; Estonia; Finland; France; Germany; Greece; Hong Kong SAR, China;
Iceland; Ireland; Israel; Italy; Japan; the Republic of Korea; Latvia; Lithuania; Luxembourg; Malta; the Netherlands; New Zealand; Norway; Portugal; Singapore; the Slovak Republic;
Slovenia; Spain; Sweden; Switzerland; the United Kingdom; and the United States. Since Croatia became a member of the euro area on January 1, 2023, it has been removed from the list of
EMDEs, and related growth aggregates, to avoid double counting.
2. An economy is defined as commodity exporter when, on average in 2017-19, either (1) total commodities exports accounted for 30 percent or more of total exports or (2) exports of any
single commodity accounted for 20 percent or more of total exports. Economies for which these thresholds were met as a result of re-exports were excluded. When data were not available,
judgment was used. This taxonomy results in the classification of some well-diversified economies as importers, even if they are exporters of certain commodities (for example, Mexico).
3. Commodity importers are EMDEs not classified as commodity exporters.

         CHAPTER 2


REGIONAL OUTLOOKS


Growth in the East Asia and Pacific (EAP) region is projected at 4.3 percent in 2023—a pickup from last
year’s estimated 3.2 percent pace, and almost entirely on account of a projected rebound in China. As mobility
restrictions ease, growth in China is forecast to firm from 2.7 percent in 2022 to 4.3 percent this year, still
below its potential growth rate owing to continued pandemic-related disruptions. Growth in the rest of the
region is expected to slow from 5.6 percent in 2022 to 4.7 percent in 2023, as pent-up demand dissipates and
declining goods export growth outweighs recovery in tourism and travel. Downside risks to the outlook
predominate, including the possibility of recurrent pandemic-related disruptions and a prolonged drag from the
real estate sector in China, additional tightening of financial conditions, weaker-than-expected global growth,
and extreme weather events.

1. Data are based on GDP measured in average 2010-19 prices and market exchange rates. Values for Timor-Leste represent non-oil GDP. For the following countries, values correspond to
fiscal years: the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, Myanmar, and Palau (October 1– September 30); Nauru, Samoa, and Tonga (July 1–June 30).
2. Forecasts for Myanmar beyond 2023 are excluded because of a high degree of uncertainty.

Growth in Europe and Central Asia (ECA) is estimated to have sharply decelerated in 2022, to 0.2 percent,
and is projected to remain essentially unchanged at 0.1 percent in 2023. This weakness largely reflects
contraction in the Russian Federation in both years and a deep recession in Ukraine in 2022. Excluding these
two economies, output in ECA is forecast to grow by a modest 2.1 percent in 2023. Disruptions to the supply of
energy in Europe, related to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and synchronous monetary policy tightening have
dampened economic activity, affecting ECA’s economies both directly and through spillovers from the euro area.
The near-term economic outlook remains especially uncertain, with risks to the baseline forecast tilted to the
downside. These risks include an additional tightening of global financial conditions, financial turmoil, and
worsening energy shortages.

Growth in Latin America and the Caribbean is forecast to slow to a meager 1.3 percent in 2023 before
recovering somewhat to 2.4 percent in 2024. Decelerating global demand will dampen the external drivers of
near-term growth in the region, while domestic demand will be curbed by monetary policy tightening and
persistent policy uncertainty in some countries. The main downside risks to the outlook are external: tightening
global financial conditions could precipitate capital outflows and currency depreciations, and the global
economy could slow more than predicted, leading to sharp falls in commodity export prices. These or other
adverse shocks could reduce growth further, which could catalyze social unrest, given stagnating living
standards. Climate-related disasters also remain an ever-present threat, especially for the region’s small states.

Growth in the Middle East and North Africa region is projected to slow to 3.5 percent in 2023, as the boost
from the earlier increase in oil production and the recovery in services following reopening from the pandemic
fade. Prospects vary substantially across the region, with some economies facing macroeconomic instability and
conflict while others grow above their potential. Spillovers from further weakness in key trading partners, tighter
global financial conditions, increasing climate-related risks, rising social tensions, and political instability
highlight the possibility of further economic contractions and increasing poverty. A further deterioration in
global and domestic financial or economic conditions could see economies with large macroeconomic imbalances
fall into crisis.

South Asia continues to be adversely affected by spillovers from the invasion of Ukraine, rising global interest
rates, and weakening growth in key trading partners. Regional growth is estimated to have slowed to 6.1
percent in 2022 and is projected to slow further to 5.5 percent in 2023—below previous projections on global
spillovers—before picking up to 5.8 percent in 2024. Risks to the outlook continue to be tilted to the downside,
including further pressure from tightening global financial conditions; higher-than-projected inflation leading
to lower real incomes and spending; and the reemergence of financial sector stress. Dwindling international
reserves and rising sovereign spreads increase the risk of more economies falling into crisis.

1. Historical data is reported on a market price basis. National income and product account data refer to fiscal years (FY) with the exception of Afghanistan, Maldives, and Sri Lanka,
which report in calendar year. The fiscal year runs from July 1 through June 30 in Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Pakistan; from July 16 through July 15 in Nepal; and April 1 through March
31 in India.
2. Data for Afghanistan beyond 2021 are excluded because of a high degree of uncertainty.

Growth in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) slowed to an estimated 3.4 percent in 2022, as weakening external
demand, high inflation, and tightening global financial conditions dampened regional activity. Soaring food
and energy prices, stemming partly from the war in Ukraine, triggered sharp cost-of-living increases across the
region, leading to millions more people falling into food insecurity and poverty. Global demand for many non-
energy commodities softened, adversely affecting the region’s exporters of industrial metals. Fiscal space needed to
protect the poor has been depleted in many countries, while rising borrowing costs and muted growth prospects
have sharply worsened debt dynamics. The regional outlook for 2023-24 is for only a modest pickup in growth
and a slow rise in per capita incomes, dimming prospects for a rapid reversal of recent increases in poverty. Risks
are tilted to the downside. A more pronounced weakness in major economies, further increases in global interest
rates, higher and persistent inflation, fragility, and increased frequency and intensity of adverse weather events
could further slow growth across the region, exacerbating poverty and leading to debt distress in some countries.

Note: e = estimate; f = forecast; PPP = purchasing power parity; EMDE = emerging market and developing economy. World Bank forecasts are frequently updated based on new information
and changing (global) circumstances. Consequently, projections presented here may differ from those contained in other Bank documents, even if basic assessments of countries’ prospects
do not differ at any given moment in time.
1. GDP and expenditure components are measured in average 2010-19 prices and market exchange rates.
2. Subregion aggregate excludes the Central African Republic, Eritrea, Guinea, São Tomé and Príncipe, Somalia, and South Sudan, for which data limitations prevent the forecasting of GDP
components.
3. Subregion growth rates may differ from the most recent edition of Africa's Pulse (https://www.worldbank.org/en/region/afr/publication/africas-pulse) because of data revisions and the
inclusion of the Central African Republic and São Tomé and Príncipe in the subregion aggregate of that publication.
4. Exports and imports of goods and nonfactor services (GNFS).
5. Includes Angola, Cameroon, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Ghana, Nigeria, and South Sudan.
6. The Financial Community of Africa (CFA) franc zone consists of 14 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, each affiliated with one of two monetary unions. The Central African Economic and
Monetary Union (CEMAC) comprises Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Chad, the Republic of Congo, Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon; the West African Economic and Monetary Union
(WAEMU) comprises Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Guinea-Bissau, Mali, Niger, Senegal, and Togo.

INVESTMENT GROWTH
 AFTER THE PANDEMIC


GLOBAL ECONOMIC PROSPECTS | JANUARY 2023                                                                      CHAPTER 3   103



Investment growth in emerging market and developing economies (EMDEs) is expected to remain below its
average rate of the past two decades through the medium term. This subdued outlook follows a decade-long,
geographically widespread investment growth slowdown before the COVID-19 pandemic. An empirical analysis
covering 2000-21 finds that periods of strong investment growth were associated with strong real output growth,
robust real credit growth, terms of trade improvements, growth in capital inflows, and investment climate
reform spurts. Each of these factors has been decreasingly supportive of investment growth since the 2007-09
global financial crisis. Weak investment growth is a concern because it dampens potential growth, is associated
with weak trade, and makes achieving the development and climate-related goals more difficult. Policies to
boost investment growth need to be tailored to country circumstances, but include comprehensive fiscal and
structural reforms, including repurposing of expenditure on inefficient subsidies. Given EMDEs’ limited fiscal
space, the international community will need to significantly increase international cooperation, official
financing and grants, and leverage private sector financing for adequate investment to materialize.

Note: * = EMDE commodity importers. Each EMDE is classified as a commodity importer or commodity exporter. An economy is defined as commodity exporter when, on average in
2017-19, either (1) total commodity exports accounted for 30 percent or more of total exports or (2) exports of any single commodity accounted for 20 percent or more of total exports.
Economies for which these thresholds were met due to reexports were excluded. When data were not available, judgment was used. This taxonomy results in the classification of some
well-diversified economies as importers, even if they are exporters of certain commodities (for example, Mexico). Pakistan and Bangladesh are not included in the sample because these
countries report annual investment data for their fiscal year which does not align with the calendar year.

Small states’ economies were hit particularly hard by COVID-19, largely due to prolonged disruptions to global
tourism. Now facing spillovers from the Russian Federation’s invasion of Ukraine and the global monetary
tightening cycle, small states are expected to have weak recoveries with large and possibly permanent losses to the
level of output. Small states are diverse in their economic features, but they share attributes that make them
especially vulnerable to shocks, including dependence on imports of essential goods, highly concentrated
economies, elevated levels of debt, reliance on external financing, and susceptibility to natural disasters and
climate change. Policy makers in small states can improve long-term growth prospects by building fiscal space,
fostering effective economic diversification, and improving resilience to climate change. There is a need for
intensified international cooperation to support small states in addressing their challenges. The global
community can assist small states in these efforts by maintaining the flow of official assistance, helping restore
and preserve debt sustainability, facilitating trade, and supporting climate change adaptation.

Note: FCS = fragile and conflict-affected situations. Tourism-reliant countries are those with inbound tourism expenditure as a share of GDP during 2015-19 above the 3rd percentile of the
share in all EMDEs, based on UN World Tourism Organization data. Agriculture-exporting and energy-exporting economies are those where exports of agriculture or energy commodities
accounted for 20 percent or more of total exports, on average, in 2017-19. Economies that meet these thresholds as a result of re-exports are excluded. The six countries classified as FCS
as of the World Bank’s fiscal year 2023 were also considered FCS for at least 10 years during fiscal years 2006-23. Fixed exchange rates include managed arrangements, pegs within
horizontal bands, crawl-like arrangements, crawling pegs, stabilized arrangements, conventional pegs, currency boards, and the absence of a country-issued legal tender. Remittance-reliant
countries are those with remittance inflows as a share of GDP during 2015-20 above the 75th percentile of all EMDEs (that is., above 8 percent of GDP), based on World Bank data.

1. Aggregate growth rates calculated using GDP weights at average 2010-19 prices and market exchange rates.
2. Quarterly estimates are based on non-seasonally-adjusted real GDP, except for advanced economies, as well as Algeria, Ecuador, Morocco, and Tunisia. In some instances, quarterly
growth paths may not align to annual growth estimates, owing to the timing of GDP releases. Quarterly data for Jamaica are gross value added. Quarterly data for Montenegro are
preliminary. Data for Timor-Leste represent non-oil GDP.
Regional averages are calculated based on data from the following economies.
East Asia and Pacific: China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mongolia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam.
Europe and Central Asia: Albania, Armenia, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Georgia, Hungary, Kazakhstan, Moldova, North Macedonia, Poland, Romania, the Russian
Federation, Serbia, Türkiye, and Ukraine.

The World Bank Group is committed to reducing its environmental footprint.
In support of this commitment, we leverage electronic publishing options and
print-on-demand technology, which is located in regional hubs worldwide.
Together, these initiatives enable print runs to be lowered and shipping
distances decreased, resulting in reduced paper consumption, chemical use,
greenhouse gas emissions, and waste.

We follow the recommended standards for paper use set by the Green Press
Initiative. The majority of our books are printed on Forest Stewardship Council
(FSC)-certified paper, with nearly all containing 50-100 percent recycled
content. The recycled fiber in our book paper is either unbleached or bleached
using totally chlorine-free (TCF), processed chlorine-free (PCF), or enhanced
elemental chlorine-free (EECF) processes.

G    lobal growth is projected to decelerate sharply, reflecting
synchronous policy tightening aimed at containing very high
inflation, worsening financial conditions, and continued disruptions
from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Investment growth in emerging
market and developing economies (EMDEs) is expected to remain
below its average rate of the past two decades. Further adverse
shocks could push the global economy into recession. Small states
are especially vulnerable to such shocks because of the reliance
on external trade and financing, limited economic diversification,
elevated debt, and susceptibility to natural disasters. Against
this backdrop, it is critical that EMDE policy makers ensure that
any fiscal support is focused on vulnerable groups, that inflation
expectations remain well anchored, and that financial systems
continue to be resilient. Urgent global and national efforts are also
needed to mitigate the risks of global recession and debt distress
in EMDEs, and to support a major increase in EMDE investment.

Global Economic Prospects is a World Bank Group Flagship Report
that examines global economic developments and prospects,
with a special focus on emerging market and developing
economies, on a semiannual basis (in January and June). Each
edition includes analytical pieces on topical policy challenges faced
by these economies.
